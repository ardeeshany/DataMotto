`DataMotto` is an R-pkg website where users can learn, build, and share multilingual data skills efficiently. Putting `minimality` as the heart of DataMotto's philosophy, we aim to build high quality data resources in a conventional format called `Dotto`. The `Dotto`s are developed based on the best practice coding and state of the art packages to solve a data science problem efficiently. For each `Dotto`'s problem, we develop the solutions in different popular programming languages that everyone can enjoy no matter what language they are comfortable with. The core languages we cover are `R`, `Python`, `Julia`, `SQL` and `nodeJS`.

## DataMotto Structure

### TL; Dr

- `Dot`s > `Dotto` > `Line` > `Space`

#### Dotto:
`DataMotto` is designed to create a dynamic modularized data educational materials. `Dotto`s are the key elements and core of DataMotto. They are self-explanatory, autonomous, multilingual data resources that are designed to be right to the point and solve a problem concisely. To make more sense, everyone can think of `Dotto` as a high quality summary of an online course, overview of a book chapter, review of a `package` or group of `packages`, technical summary of a paper, real-world case study, Interview preparation materials and many other scenarios.

#### Dot:
Each `Dotto` is composed of some `Dot`s, which are the smallest component of DataMotto. All `Dot`s has three parts: `Instruction`, `Codes` and `Results`. Our conventional framework has some rules for creating Dots:

1. `Instruction` section has a limit of `560` characters. They cover briefly the problem, instruction, or other resources you may need to check

1. `Codes` part has a limit of `15` lines including comments.

1. `Results` part includes only one table, figure, or list. You may see and interpretation of the results here as well (uo to `280` characters).

#### Line:

Considering DataMotto as a modularized platform with having `Dotto`s as the modules, bundling `Dotto`s can
