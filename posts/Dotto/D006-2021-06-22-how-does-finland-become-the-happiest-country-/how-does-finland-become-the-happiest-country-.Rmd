title: "How does Finland become the happiest country?"
description: |
  The World Happiness dataset contains six factors to measure global happiness: life expectancy, economics, social support, absence of corruption, freedom, and generosity. These factors were reported for 155 countries around the world from 2005 to 2020. In this Dotto, we want to find the top five happiest countries then plot the happiness rate for these countries for the 2010s.

```{r DataMotto, echo=FALSE}
DataMotto::use_Dotto()
```

<!-- Dot 1, lang: python ------------------------------------------------>

```{block, Dot = 1, part = "Instruction", lang = "python"}
In this Dot, we import packages and World Happiness dataset.
```

```{python, Dot = 1, part = "Code", echo = T, eval = F, }
# Import Packacges
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load World Happiness Dataset
data = pd.read_csv('D:/world-happiness-report.csv')
data.head(5)
```

```{python, Dot = 1, part = "Result", echo = F, eval = T}

```


<!-- Dot 2, lang: python ------------------------------------------------>

```{block, Dot = 2, part = "Instruction", lang = "python"}
After we import dataset, we drop 2 unnecessery columns ('Positive affect' , 'Negative affect'), and select rows after 2015.
```

```{python, Dot = 2, part = "Code", echo = T, eval = F, }
# Drop Unnecessery Columns
data = data.drop(['Positive affect' , 'Negative affect'],axis=1)

# Select Dataset from 2016-2020
data = data[data['year'] > 2015]
```

```{python, Dot = 2, part = "Result", echo = F, eval = T}

```



<!-- Dot 3, lang: python ------------------------------------------------>
```{block, Dot = 3, part = "Instruction", lang = "python"}
Now we have a dataset for 2015 to 2020 for all country. In this dot, we want calculate the mean Life Ladder for each country, and find the top happiest country in the world.
```

```{python, Dot = 3, part = "Code", echo = T, eval = F, }
# Grouping Data by Country
data_grouped_country = data.groupby('Country name').mean()
data_grouped_country.head(5)

# Sort the New Dataset by Life Ladder column
data_grouped_country.sort_values(['Life Ladder'],ascending=False).head(5)
```

```{python, Dot = 3, part = "Result", echo = F, eval = T}

```

<!-- Dot 4, lang: python ------------------------------------------------>
```{block, Dot = 4, part = "Instruction", lang = "python"}
In the last dot we identified that Finland, Denmark, Switzerland, Iceland,
and Netherlands are the top-five happiest country in the world. Now, we want plot the Life Ladder to show how does Finland become the happiest country since 2015.
```

```{python, Dot = 4, part = "Code", echo = T, eval = F, }
# Select New Dataset for the Top-five Happiest Country
data_top_five = data[data['Country name'].isin(
  ['Finland', 'Denmark', 'Switzerland', 'Iceland','Netherlands'])]

# Plot a catplot for the top-5 Happiest Country
sns.catplot(data = data_top_five ,
  x='year',y= 'Life Ladder' ,hue='Country name' ,
  kind = 'point')
plt.show()
```

```{python, Dot = 4, part = "Result", echo = F, eval = T}

```
