title: "How does Finland become the happiest country"
description: |
  The World Happiness dataset contains six factors to measure global happiness: life expectancy, economics, social support, absence of corruption, freedom, and generosity. These factors were reported for 166 countries around the world from 2005 to 2020. In this Dotto, we want to find the top five happiest countries then plot the happiness rate for these countries from 2015 to 2019.

In the first DOT, we import two packages:

Then we import the [**World Happiness**](https://www.kaggle.com/ajaypalsinghlo/world-happiness-report-2021)  dataset and select rows for 2015 to 2019 for all countries.

<!-- Dot 4, lang: r, python ------------------------------------------------>

The final Dot is to plot the trend of Life Ladder from 2015 to 2019. 
The line plot shows that **Finland** has been increasing considerably and reached its peak in 2018.
For **Switzerland** and **Denmark**, we can see an increasing trend like Finland. On the other hand,  **Iceland** has a slight fluctuation, and  **Norway** has a decreasing trend in this period.
