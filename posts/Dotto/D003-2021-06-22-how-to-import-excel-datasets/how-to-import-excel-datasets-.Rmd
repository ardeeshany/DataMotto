<!-- Dot 1, lang: r ------------------------------------------------>

```{block, Dot = 1, part = "Instruction", lang = "r"}
- **Description About Package**

The [readxl package](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/) makes it easy to get data out of Excel and into R. Compared to many of the existing packages (e.g. gdata, xlsx, xlsReadWrite) readxl has no external dependencies, so itâ€™s easy to install and use on all operating systems. It is designed to work with tabular data.

- **Description About Dataset**

In this Dotto we use [COVID-19 dataset](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/COVID-19-geographic-disbtribution-worldwide.xlsx).

- **How Does It Work?**

After install readxl package with `install.packages("readxl")` command, we can import excel file with `read_excel()` method and with `head()` method see the specific row of data.

```

```{block, Dot = 1, part = "Instruction", lang = "python"}
- **Description About Package**

[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.

- **Description About Dataset**

In this Dotto we use [COVID-19 dataset](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/COVID-19-geographic-disbtribution-worldwide.xlsx).

- **How Does It Work?**

After install readxl package with `pip install pandas` command, we can import excel file with `read_excel()` method and with `head()` method see the specific row of data.

```

```{r, Dot = 1, part = "Code", echo = T, eval = F, }
# Import readxl library
library(readxl)

# read_excel() function get path of our data set to load it in our project
covidDatasetLocal <- read_excel('./COVID-19-geographic-disbtribution-worldwide.xlsx')

# print 10 first rows of our data
head(covidDatasetLocal,10)
```

```{python, Dot = 1, part = "Code", echo = T, eval = F,}
# Import pandas library
import pandas as pd

# read_excel() function get path of our data set to load it in our project
covidDatasetLocal = pd.read_excel(
    './COVID-19-geographic-disbtribution-worldwide.xlsx')

# print 10 first rows of our data
covidDatasetLocal.head(10)
```

```{r, Dot = 1, part = "Result", echo = F, eval = T}
library(readxl)

covidDatasetLocal <- read_excel('./COVID-19-geographic-disbtribution-worldwide.xlsx')

head(covidDatasetLocal,10)
```

```{python, Dot = 1, part = "Result", echo = F, eval = T}
import pandas as pd
covidDatasetLocal = pd.read_excel(
    './COVID-19-geographic-disbtribution-worldwide.xlsx')
covidDatasetLocal.head(10)
```

```{block, Dot = 2, part = "Instruction", lang = "r"}
- **How Does It Work?**

Now we want to import an online excel file. In R language we first download the file as a temporary file and then import the excel file in the project.

```

```{block, Dot = 2, part = "Instruction", lang = "python"}
- **How Does It Work?**

Now we want to import an online excel file. In Python language, pandas library handles this by itself. we set the URL of the excel file then pandas download this file and import it to the project.

```

```{r, Dot = 2, part = "Code", echo = T, eval = F,}
# initial temporary file with xlsx extension
tempFile <- tempfile(fileext = '.xlsx')

# online excel file URL
excelFileURL <- 'https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/COVID-19-geographic-disbtribution-worldwide.xlsx'

# download excel file 
download.file(excelFileURL, destfile = tempFile, mode = 'wb')

# import excel file in to our project
covidDatasetOnline <- read_excel(tempFile)

head(covidDatasetOnline,10)
```

```{python, Dot = 2, part = "Code", echo = T, eval = F,}
# online excel file URL
excelFileURL = 'https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/COVID-19-geographic-disbtribution-worldwide.xlsx'

# download and import excel file 
covidDatasetOnline = pd.read_excel(excelFileURL)

covidDatasetOnline.head(10)
```

```{r, Dot = 2, part = "Result", echo = F, eval = T}
tempFile <- tempfile(fileext = '.xlsx')

excelFileURL <- 'https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/COVID-19-geographic-disbtribution-worldwide.xlsx'

download.file(excelFileURL, destfile = tempFile, mode = 'wb')

covidDatasetOnline <- read_excel(tempFile)

head(covidDatasetOnline,10)
```

```{python, Dot = 2, part = "Result", echo = F, eval = T}
excelFileURL = 'https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/COVID-19-geographic-disbtribution-worldwide.xlsx'

# download and import excel file 
covidDatasetOnline = pd.read_excel(excelFileURL)

covidDatasetOnline.head(10)
```

```{block, Dot = 3, part = "Instruction", lang = "r"}
- **How Does It Work?**

In some situations, we want to skip some columns or specify the columns' names. Now we want to handle this when we importing the excel file.

```{python, Dot = 3, part = "Code", echo = T, eval = F,}
# default value of header parameter is 0 and tell to python that first row is label of columns  
# usecols parameter gets a range of columns that we want to import to our project. Now we skip the A column because the range starts from B.
covidDatasetLocal = pd.read_excel(
