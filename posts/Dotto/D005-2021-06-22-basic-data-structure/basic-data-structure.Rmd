R.This Dot illustrates how to define a variable , change variable type and
chaning assignment in R.
```
<!-- Dot 1, lang: python ------------------------------------------------>

Python. This Dot illustrates how to define a variable , change variable type and 
chaning assignment in Python.
```

```{r, Dot = 1, part = "Code", echo = T, eval = F, }
x <- "apple"
x
#chaning assignment in R
y <- z <- x
# Assignment using equal operator
a = "orange"

```

```{python, Dot = 1, part = "Code", echo = T, eval = F, }
#variable assignment

print("x is :",x)
print("x class type:",type(x))
#change variable type from str to int
x = int(x)
print("new x class type:",type(x))
#chained assignmen:

print(n,m,x)
print("n=",n," m=",m," x=",x)
```

```{r, Dot = 1, part = "Result", echo = F, eval = T}

R.Vector is a basic data structure in R which contains element of the same type.
The data types can be logical, integer, double, character, complex or raw.
for more information,see https://www.datamentor.io/r-programming/vector/
```

<!-- Dot 2, lang: python ------------------------------------------------>

```{block, Dot = 2, part = "Instruction", lang = "python"}
Python. List is a mutable built_in data structure in python that allows us to store 
sets of information in one place.
Lists are one of Python's most powerful features readily accessible to new programmers,
and they tie together many important concepts in programming.
```

```{r, Dot = 2, part = "Code", echo = T, eval = F, }
x <- c(1, 5, 4, 9, 0) #create vector using c()
y <- vector(mode = "logical",length = 5)#create vector using vector()
y
x[c(1,2)] #access first and second element of vector
x [x > 4] #filtering elements of x based on condition
x[2] <- 10 #modify 2nd element of x from 5 to 10
x [x < 3] <- 3 #modify elements less than 3 to 3
y <- NULL #delete vector
y
```

```{python, Dot = 2, part = "Code", echo = T, eval = F, }
A=[1,2,"Hi"]
print("last element od list A:",A[-1])
A = [i**2 for i in range(1,5)]
print('new list A is:' , A)
A.insert(2,12)# add 12 at position 2 in list
A.append(4) #add 4 to the end of the list
print("A after adding 12 at position 2 and appending 4:",A)
A.reverse()
print('A after reversing:',A)
print("index of element 16 is :",A.index(16))
A.sort(reverse = True)
print("sorted A descending order:",A)
print("number of element 4 in list A:",A.count(4))
print("A.pop(0) will remove the first element in list A and return it's value:")
A.pop(0)
print("list A after removing it's first element:",A)
```

```{r, Dot = 2, part = "Result", echo = F, eval = T}
x <- c(1, 5, 4, 9, 0) #create vector using c()

<!-- Dot 3, lang: r ------------------------------------------------>
```{block, Dot = 3, part = "Instruction", lang = "r"}
R.Factor is a data structure used to represent categorical data.For example,
a data field like gender will contain only values of male,female or other.
Factors in R are stored as a vector of integer that each integer has a label.
One of the most important uses of factors is in statistical modeling; since 
categorical variables enter into statistical models differently than continuous 
variables, storing data as factors insures that the modeling functions will 
treat such data correctly.
for more information,see https://www.datamentor.io/r-programming/factor/
```
<!-- Dot 3, lang: python ------------------------------------------------>
```{block, Dot = 3, part = "Instruction", lang = "python"}
Python. Tuple is an ordered collection of objects in Python.
You can't change tuple atfer defining it(unlike list).
```

```{r, Dot = 3, part = "Code", echo = T, eval = F, }
#create a factor using factor():
factor1 <- factor(c("male","female","female","male"))
levels(factor1) #shows levels of factor1
table(factor1) #returns number of each level
#we can determine the order of levels:
factor2 <- factor(c("pass","pass","fail","pass","fail"), levels = c("pass" , "fail"))
factor2
factor2[c(3,4)] #access 3rd and 4th element of factor2
#illustrate how to modify elements(CANNOT assign values outside levels):
factor1[1] <- "female"
levels(factor1) <- c(levels(factor1),"other") #adding new level
factor1[2] <- "other" #modify 2nd element of factor1
factor1
```

```{python, Dot = 3, part = "Code", echo = T, eval = F, }
t1 = ("hello",5,4)
print("second elemnt of tuple t1:",t1[1])
try:
  t1[2] = "good"
except TypeError:
  print("'tuple' object does not support item assignment(immutable)")
t2 =  t1 + (6,7,8)
print("t2 is :",t2)
#showing packing and unpacking variables with tuple
print("t2 is : ",t2)
(a,b,c) = (10,11,"apple")
print("a :",a," ,b :",b ," ,c :",c)
a , c = c, a
print("new a :",a," ,new c :",c)
```

```{r, Dot = 3, part = "Result", echo = F, eval = T}

R.Matrix is a two dimensional data structure in R programming.
Matrix is similar to vector but additionally contains the dimension attribute.
All attributes of an object can be checked with the attributes() function
(dimension can be checked directly with the dim() function).
for more information,see https://www.datamentor.io/r-programming/matrix/
```

and has no duplicate values.

<!-- Dot 5, lang: python ------------------------------------------------>
```{block, Dot = 5, part = "Instruction", lang = "r"}
R. A list is a collection of elements which can be of different types.
A vector  having all elements of the same type is called atomic vector(vector)
but a vector having elements of diffrent types is called list.
You can also see https://www.datamentor.io/r-programming/list/
```
<!-- Dot 5, lang: python ------------------------------------------------>

```{block, Dot = 5, part = "Instruction", lang = "python"}
Python. Python's dictionaries allow you to connect pieces of related
information.Each piece of information in a dictionary is stored as a key-value pair.
When you provide a key, Python returns the value associated with that key.
```

```{r, Dot = 5, part = "Code", echo = T, eval = F, }
list1 <- list(TRUE,"hello",1:4)
list1
#We can also set tags(a,b,c are tags here) for list elements.Doing this,
#our list will be like dictionary in Python:
list2 <- list("a" = TRUE, "b" = "hello", "c" = 1:4)
list2
list2[[1]] #access 1st element of list2
list2$b #access element of list2 named b
list2$b <- "bye!" #modify 2nd element of list2(element named "b")
list2$d <- 10.5 #add new element to list
list2
list2$c <- NULL #delete element named c from list2
list2
```

```{python, Dot = 5, part = "Code", echo = T, eval = F, }
dict1 = {"a":1,"b":2,"c":3} #define a dictionary
print("a is a key and it's value is :",dict1.get("a"))
print("True") if "b" in dict1 else print("False")#search in dictionary
dict1["d"] = 4 #add a new pair to dictionary
dict1["c"] = "10" #modify c's value
del dict1["a"]
print("dict1 after deleting a_1 pair :",dict1)
print("length of dict1 :",len(dict1))
#Looping through all key-value pairs:
for alphabet,number in dict1.items():
  print(alphabet+" : ",number)
#looping through all the keys:
for alphabet in dict1.keys():
  print(alphabet)
#looping through all values:
for number in dict1.keys():
  print(number)
  
```

```{r, Dot = 5, part = "Result", echo = F, eval = T}

#We can also set tags(a,b,c are tags here) for list elements.Doing this,

list2

R. Data Frame is a special case of a list where all elements are the same 
length.The main usage of data frame is storing tabular data.
Data Frames can be created using data.frame().

```{block, Dot = 6, part = "Instruction", lang = "python"}
Puthon. A DataFrame is a table. It contains an array of individual entries, each of which has a certain value. Each entry corresponds to a row (or record) and a column.
Data frame is one of the most commonly used pandas objects.
```

df1[["Name"]] #access column "Name"
df1[1, ] #access 1st row of df1(Matrix subsetting)
df1[, 2 ] #access 2nd column of df1(Matrix subsetting)
df1[2,"Age"] <- 30 #modify one component of data frame
df1
df1 <-rbind(df1,list(1,16,"Paul")) #add a new record to data frame using rbind()
