<!-- Dot 1, lang: r, python ------------------------------------------------>

```{block, Dot = 1, part = "Instruction", lang = "r"}
[Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html#) is a Python data visualization library based on [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

Since it's not always easy to decide how to best tell the story behind your data, we've broken the chart types into three broad categories to help with this.

- **Trends:** A trend is defined as a pattern of change.
  - `sns.lineplot`
- **Relationship:** Understand relationships between variables in your data.
  - `sns.barplot`
  - `sns.heatmap`
  - `sns.scatterplot`
  - `sns.regplot`
  - `sns.lmplot`
  - `sns.swarmplot`
- **Distribution:** We visualize distributions to show the possible values that we can expect to see in a variable, along with how likely they are.
  - `sns.histplot`
  - `sns.kdeplot`
  - `sns.jointplot`

<!-- Dot 2, lang: r, python ------------------------------------------------>

```{block, Dot = 2, part = "Instruction", lang = "r"}
`sns.lineplot` - **Line charts** are best to show trends over a period of time, and multiple lines can be used to show trends in more than one group. The relationship between x and y can be shown for different subsets of the data using the `hue`, `size`, and `style` parameters. Check the [documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.lineplot.html) for more details.

```


<!-- Dot 3, lang: r, python ------------------------------------------------>

```{block, Dot = 3, part = "Instruction", lang = "r"}
`sns.barplot` - **Bar charts** are useful for comparing quantities corresponding to different groups. Show point estimates and confidence intervals as rectangular bars. Check the [documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.barplot.html) for more details.

<!-- Dot 4, lang: r, python ------------------------------------------------>

```{block, Dot = 4, part = "Instruction", lang = "r"}
`sns.heatmap` - **Heatmaps** can be used to find color-coded patterns in tables of numbers. A heat map is a data visualization technique that shows magnitude of a phenomenon as color in two dimensions. The variation in color may be by hue or intensity, giving obvious visual cues to the reader about how the phenomenon is clustered or varies over space.  Check the [documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.heatmap.html) for more details.

<!-- Dot 5, lang: r, python ------------------------------------------------>

```{block, Dot = 5, part = "Instruction", lang = "r"}
`sns.scatterplot` - **Scatter plots** show the relationship between two continuous variables; if color-coded, we can also show the relationship with a third [categorical variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_variable). The relationship between `x` and `y` can be shown for different subsets of the data using the `hue`, `size`, and `style` parameters. These parameters control what visual semantics are used to identify the different subsets. Check the [documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.scatterplot.html) for more details.

<!-- Dot 6, lang: r, python ------------------------------------------------>

```{block, Dot = 6, part = "Instruction", lang = "r"}
`sns.distplot` - **Histograms** Plot univariate or bivariate histograms to show distributions of datasets. A histogram is a classic visualization tool that represents the distribution of one or more variables by counting the number of observations that fall within disrete bins.

This function can normalize the statistic computed within each bin to estimate frequency, density or probability mass, and it can add a smooth curve obtained using a kernel density estimate, similar to [`kdeplot()`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.kdeplot.html#seaborn.kdeplot). Check the [documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.histplot.html) for more details.
